<p align="center" style="margin: 10px">First ideas about the possible development of the final project:</p>

- 🏛 Working with DAOs and the possibility of creating an application to govern more or less advanced governance processes
- 🎟 working with NFTs not only in the art world but also in other use cases
- 💻 developing an ERC721 and ERC20 markeplace 

These are just ideas to bootstrap the final project. I'd like to work intensively with Solidity and the interaction between contract instances, emit events and working with structures. From the next sections I'll try to submit some more detail ideas and workflow for the project.

🍻 Cheers
